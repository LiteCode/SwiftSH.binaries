This is a binary for ease of use in SwiftTerm of the 
https://github.com/Frugghi/SwiftSH Swift SSH client.

You should get your own copy for deployment purposes,
this is merely to make (a) my life easier, and (b)
to not bloat the SwiftTerm repo with binary artifacts.

I wish Frugghi/SwiftSH supported Swift Package Manager,
that would solve a lot of problems
